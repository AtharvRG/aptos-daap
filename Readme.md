# 📝 Blockchain-Based Document Management dApp  

Welcome to the **Blockchain Document Management dApp**! 🚀 This decentralized application allows you to securely create, store, and manage documents while ensuring transparency, security, and trust. Built on the **Aptos blockchain** and powered by **IPFS**, it’s perfect for scenarios requiring multiple signatures or approvals.  

## 🌟 Features  
- **Secure Document Storage**: Save document data on IPFS and store the hash on the blockchain.  
- **Multi-Signature Support**: Enable multiple users to sign documents securely.  
- **Transparent Tracking**: Keep track of changes, signatures, and approvals in real time.  
- **Immutable Records**: Ensure no unauthorized modifications with blockchain security.  

## 🎯 Use Cases  
- **Legal Agreements**: Securely sign contracts with multiple parties.  
- **Approval Workflows**: Manage documents requiring approval from multiple stakeholders.  
- **Financial Transactions**: Store and track critical multi-signer agreements.  

## 🛠️ What We Built  
- A single **Aptos Move contract** to manage all operations:  
  - Document creation and data storage.  
  - User-friendly signing functionality.  
  - Retrieval of document details and signature status.  

## 💾 How It Works  
1. **Upload the Document**: Store the document on IPFS for decentralized access.  
2. **Save the Hash**: The IPFS hash is securely stored in the contract.  
3. **Collaborate & Sign**: Invite parties to sign the document directly on the dApp.  
4. **Immutable Validation**: Once all required signatures are collected, the document is locked and validated.  

## 📦 Technology Stack  
- **Aptos Blockchain**  
- **Aptos Move** smart contracts  
- **IPFS** for decentralized file storage  

## 🚀 Get Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/<your-repo-name>.git  
   ```
2. Install dependencies and deploy the contract.
3. Start using the dApp to manage your documents securely.

## 💡 Why Choose Blockchain for Document Management?

1. **Unmatched Security**: Blockchain prevents unauthorized changes.
2. **Transparent Collaboration**: Track who signed and when.
3. **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS ensures data redundancy and accessibility.
